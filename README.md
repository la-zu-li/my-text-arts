# my-text-arts

This is a repository where I put my _text-arts_.

## definition of digital-text-art

I call digital-text-art any kind of use of displayed digital text characters to produce art.

Basically, a digital-text-art could be some sort of digital text which purpose isn't only store information or display information to be read in a linear way, or any common uses of digital text information.

That wouldn't be necessarily visual art, or _strictly_ visual art.

In this repository, I will frequently shorten it to only "text-art".

## text-art in this repository

I put all the text-art I created in this repository. All of them happen to be visual art, but that can change. There's two kinds of visual text-art in this repository.

- ASCII art. It consists in visual art that uses only ASCII characters. If the font used to display the characters is a monospace font, the outcome can be something that very much looks like monochromatic pixel-art, with each ASCII character representing a pixel. Each different character could represent a different degree of luminosity, with characters that display a blank space being zero luminosity (a black pixel) and the character "@" being the maximum luminosity (a white pixel). Another form of producing art with this is using the shape of ASCII characters to draw lines and/or objects in the file.

- Braille art. It consists in visual art that uses only braille alphabet characters. Braille alphabet virtual characters are formed using a combination of eight raised dots arranged in a 4 Ã— 2 matrix. The number and arrangement of these dots distinguishes one character from another. The outcome is something that very much looks like monochromatic binary pixel-art, with each dot being a pixel. That means each braille character can represent 8 pixels, arranging blank or not. This approach has only two possibilities for each pixel (filled or blank), but it produces much smaller arts, that can be more easily displayed and visualized in websites and text files and etcetera.

## trivia

- I used [this tool](https://braille-txt.github.io/) to generate most braille arts here.
- The shrek one is actually a copypasta i got from a website, but I personally made all the others.
